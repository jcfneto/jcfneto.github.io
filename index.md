## About

As a Data Scientist passionate about Machine Learning, I have always sought to enhance my skills and knowledge in this fascinating area. This journey led me to earn a master's degree from the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), with a focus on Natural Language Processing, where I deeply explored techniques and theories at the forefront of this field.

My professional experience is marked by solving complex problems and generating significant value through data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, mathematical optimization, and software development. I am a self-taught professional with a strong scientific background, relentless curiosity, and sharp critical thinking, qualities that enable me to approach challenges innovatively.

In addition to my technical expertise, I stand out for my communication skills, capable of translating technical complexities to diverse audiences, facilitating understanding and interdisciplinary collaboration.

You should know that I'm also a huge fan of heavy metal, especially Judas Priest (trust me, I'm a HUGE fan of that band), playing CS2, and staying at home.
