In the [previous post](http://benlansdell.github.io/statistics/sdes/) we defined path integrals through a simple 'time-slicing' approach. And used them to compute moments of simple stochastic DEs. In this follow-up post we will examine how expansions can be used to approximate moments, how we can use the moment generating functional to compute probability densities, and how these methods may be helpful in some cases in neuroscience.

### Perturbative approaches {#perturbation}

For a general, non-linear, SDE the series will not terminate and must be
truncated at some point. It is then necessary to determine which terms
will contribute the sum, and to include these terms up to a given order.
We mention briefly three such possibilities, though do not discuss them
in any detail. One way of doing this is if some terms in $S_{I}$
($v_{mn}\int x^{n}\tilde{x}^{m},m\ge2$) are small. Then we can simply
let each such vertex contribute a small parameter $\alpha$ and perform
an expansion in orders of $\alpha$ (known as a ‘weak coupling expansion’
[^3]).

Another option is to perform a weak noise, or loop, expansion. Here we
scale the entire exponent in the MGF by some factor $h$
<div>
$$Z=\int\mathcal{D}x(t)\mathcal{D}\tilde{x}(t)e^{-\frac{1}{h}(S-\int\tilde{J}x-\int J\tilde{x})}$$
</div>
Then each vertex of $S_{I}$ gains a factor of $1/h$ and each edge of
$S_{F}$ gains a factor $h$ which implies we can expand in powers of $h$.
In performing this expansion, if we let $E$ denote the number of
external edges of a diagram, $I$ the number of internal edges and $V$
the number of vertices then each connected graph has a factor of
$$h^{I+E-V}$$ and, in fact, it can be shown by induction that:
$$L=I-V+1$$ where $L$ is the number of *loops* the diagram contains.
Thus, each graph collects a factor of $h^{E-L+1}$. This allows us to
order the expansion in terms of the number of loops in each diagram.
Diagrams which contain no loops are trees, or classical diagrams. Such
diagrams form the basis of the *semi-classical* approximation.

This expansion is of course only valid when the contribution of the
higher loop number diagrams is smaller than that of the lower loop
number diagrams. The *Ginzburg criterion* says when this expansion is
indeed valid.

Some other examples
-------------------

We present two further examples which demonstrate how these methods are
used.

### Example 1

A simple extension of the OU process so that it is now *mean-reverting*
(to something not zero, as in the previous case) is the SDE
<div>
$$\dot{x}(t)+a(b+x(t))-\sqrt{D}\eta(t)=0.$$
</div>
This problem is obviously very similar to the above problem and is of
course solved almost identically. This time the action of the process is
<div>
$$S=\int\left[\tilde{x}(t)(\dot{x}(t)+a(b+x(t)))+\tilde{x}(t)y\delta(t-t_{0})-\frac{D}{2}\tilde{x}^{2}(t)\right]\, dt$$
</div>
such that the free action is as before:
<div>
$$S_{F}=\int\tilde{x}(t)\left[\dot{x}(t)+ax(t))\right]\, dt$$
</div>
(the
linear, homogenous part, for which a Green’s function can be calculated)
and the interacting action is:
<div>
$$S_{I}=\int\left[\tilde{x}(t)\left(y\delta(t-t_{0})+ba\right)-\frac{D}{2}\tilde{x}^{2}(t)\right]\, dt.$$
</div>
The only details that change are thus that the vertex linear in
$\tilde{x}(t)$ changes from
<div>
$$\int\tilde{x}(t)y\delta(t-t_{0})dt\to\int\tilde{x}(t)\left(y\delta(t-t_{0})+ba\right)dt,$$
</div>
which adds an extra term to the expression for the mean:
<div>
$$\langle x(t)\rangle=H(t-t_{0})\left(ye^{-a(t-t_{0})}+b(1-ye^{-a(t-t_{0})})\right).$$
</div>
Since only this internal vertex is affected, and the second order vertex
($D\tilde{x}(t)^{2}/2$) is unaffected, the solution for the second-order
cumulant will in fact be the same as our original example:
<div>
$$\langle x(t)x(s)\rangle_{C}=D\frac{e^{2a(t-s)}-e^{2a(t+s-2t_{0})}}{2a}$$
</div>
### Example 2

Consider the harmonic oscillator with noise:
<div>
$$\ddot{x}+2\gamma\dot{x}+\omega^{2}x=\sqrt{D}\eta(t)$$
</div>
where $\eta$ is
a white noise process. Subject to initial conditions $x(0)=x_{0}$ and
$\dot{x}(0)=v_{0}$ ($t_{0}=0$). The action for this process is
<div>
$$S=\int dt\,\left(\tilde{x}\left[\ddot{x}+2\gamma\dot{x}+\omega^{2}x+v_{0}\delta(t)+x_{0}\delta'(t)\right]+\frac{D}{2}\tilde{x}^{2}\right)$$
</div>
which we will split into free and interacting components:

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
S_{F} & = \int dt\,\left(\tilde{x}\left[\ddot{x}+2\gamma\dot{x}+\omega^{2}x\right]\right)\\
S_{I} & = \int dt\,\left(\tilde{x}\left[v_{0}\delta(t)+x_{0}\delta'(t)\right]+\frac{D}{2}\tilde{x}^{2}\right)\end{aligned}$$
</div>

The free action gives the propagator as the Green’s function:
<div>
$$\left(\frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}}+2\gamma\frac{d}{dt}+\omega^{2}\right)G(t,t')=\delta(t-t')$$
</div>
which can be shown to be
<div>
$$G(t,t')=\frac{1}{\omega_{1}}H(t-t')e^{-\gamma(t-t')}\sin[\omega_{1}(t-t')],$$
</div>
for $\omega_{1}=\sqrt{\omega^{2}-\gamma^{2}}$. Once $G$ is determined
the mean and covariance can be immediately calculated through the
diagrams and calculations of the Figure 1.

<figcaption>Figure 1. Computation of first and second cumulant of Brownian motion process
with Gaussian white noise. Diagrams (with internal vertices labeled
adjacent to diagram), and the equivalent integral to evaluate to obtain
each cumulant.
</figcaption>
</figure>

We find, as expected, the following mean and covariance:

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
\langle x(t)\rangle & = \int[\delta(t')v_{0}+\delta'(t')x_{0}]G(t,t')dt'\\
 & = v_{0}G(t,0)+x_{0}G'(t,0)\\
 & = e^{-\gamma t}\left(\frac{\gamma x_{0}+v_{0}}{\omega_{1}}\sin[\omega_{1}t]+\cos[\omega_{1}t]\right)\end{aligned}$$
</div>

and (assuming $t_{1}<t_{2}$)

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
\langle x(t_{1})x(t_{2})\rangle_{C} & = D\int G(t_{1},t)G(t_{2},t)dt\\
 & = \frac{D}{\omega_{1}^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\gamma(t_{1}+t_{2}-2t)}H(t_{1}-t)H(t_{2}-t)\sin[\omega_{1}(t_{1}-t)]\sin[\omega_{1}(t_{2}-t)]dt\\
 & = \frac{D{\rm e}^{-\gamma\,{\it t_{1}}-\gamma\,{\it t_{2}}}}{4\omega_{1}^{2}\omega^{2}\gamma}\left({\rm e}^{2\,\gamma\,{\it t1}}\left[\cos\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\cos\left(\omega\,{\it t_{2}}\right)\omega_{1}^{2}+\cos\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{2}}\right)\gamma\,\omega_{1}-\cos\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{2}}\right)\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\gamma\,\omega_{1}\right]\right.\\
 & + {\rm e}^{2\,\gamma\,{\it t_{1}}}\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{2}}\right)\omega_{1}^{2}-\cos\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\cos\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{2}}\right)\omega_{1}^{2}-\omega_{1}\,\cos\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{2}}\right)\gamma\\
 & + \left.\omega_{1}\,\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\cos\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{2}}\right)\gamma-2\,\gamma^{2}\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{2}}\right)-\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{1}}\right)\sin\left(\omega_{1}\,{\it t_{2}}\right)\omega^{2}\right)\end{aligned}$$
</div>

which, with some rearrangement, simplifies to the variance[^4]:
<div>
$$\langle x(t)^{2}\rangle_{C}=\frac{D}{4\gamma\omega^{2}}\left[1-\exp(-2\gamma t)\left\{ 1+\frac{\gamma}{\omega_{1}}\left(\sin(2\omega_{1}t)+\frac{2\gamma}{\omega_{1}}\sin^{2}(\omega_{1}t)\right)\right\} \right].$$
</div>

### Connection to Fokker-Planck Equation

So far we have considered the moment generating functional, and the
probability density functional $P[x(t)]$, however often of interest is
the probability density $p(x,t)$. This can be computed from the above
framework with the following derivation.

Let $U(x_{1},t_{1}|x_{0},t_{0})$ be the transition probability between a
start point $x_{0},t_{0}$ to $x_{1},t_{1}$, then

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
U(x_{1},t_{1}|x_{0},t_{0}) & = \int\mathcal{D}x(t)\delta(x(t_{1})-x_{1})P[x(t)]\\
 & = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int d\lambda\int\mathcal{D}x(t)e^{-\lambda(x(t_{1})-x_{1})}P[x(t)]\\
 & = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int d\lambda e^{-\lambda(x_{1}-x_{0})}Z_{CM}(\lambda)\end{aligned}$$
</div>

where $Z_{CM}$ gives the moments of $x(t_{1})-x_{0}$ given
$x(t_{0})=x_{0}$
<div>
$$Z_{CM}=\int\mathcal{D}xe^{\lambda(x(t_{1})-x_{0})}P[x(t)]$$
</div>
Using the
following two relations:

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
Z_{CM}(\lambda) & = 1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\langle(x(t_{1})-x_{0})^{n}\rangle_{x(t_{0})=x_{0}}\\
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int d\lambda\, e^{-\lambda(x_{1}-x_{0})}\lambda^{n} & = \left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}}\right)^{n}\delta(x_{1}-x_{0})\end{aligned}$$
</div>

then $U$ becomes
<div>
$$U(x_{1},t_{1}|x_{0},t_{0})=\left(1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}}\right)^{n}\langle(x(t_{1})-x_{0})^{n}\rangle_{x(t_{0})=x_{0}}\right)\delta(x_{1}-x_{0}).$$
</div>
From here we can derive a relation for $p(x,t)$:

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
p(y,t+\Delta t) & = \int U(x,t+\Delta t|y',t)p(y',t)\, dy'\\
 & = \int\left(1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^{n}\langle(x(t_{1})-y')^{n}\rangle_{x(t)=y'}\right)\delta(y-y')p(y',t)\, dy'\\
 & = \left(1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^{n}\langle(x(t_{1})-y)^{n}\rangle_{x(t)=y}\right)p(y,t)\end{aligned}$$
</div>

and thus a PDE for $p(x,t)$:

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial p(y,t)}{\partial t}\Delta t & = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^{n}\langle(x(t_{1})-y)^{n}\rangle_{x(t)=y}p(y,t)+O(\Delta t^{2})\\
\frac{\partial p(y,t)}{\partial t} & = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^{n}D_{n}(y,t)p(y,t)\end{aligned}$$
</div>

as $\Delta t\to0$. This is the Kramers-Moyal expansion where
the $D_{n}$ are
<div>
$$D_{n}(y,t)=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\left.\frac{\langle(x(t+\Delta t)-y)^{n}\rangle}{\Delta t}\right|_{x(t)=y}$$
</div>
and are computed from the SDE. For example, for the Ito process
<div>
$$dx=f(x,t)dt+g(x,t)dB_{t}$$ we can compute $D_{1}(y,t)=f(y,t)$
</div>
and $D_{2}(y,t)=g(y,t)^{2}$, $D_{n}=0$ for $n>2$. Hence the PDE becomes a Fokker-Planck equation
<div>
$$\frac{\partial p(y,t)}{\partial t}=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}D_{1}(y,t)+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}D_{2}(y,t)\right)p(y,t)$$
</div>
Compute $p(x,t)=U(x,t|0,0)$ as

<div>
$$\begin{aligned}
p(x,t) & = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int d\lambda\, e^{-\lambda x}Z_{CM}(\lambda)\\
 & = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int d\lambda\, e^{-\lambda x}\exp\left[\sum_{n=1}\frac{1}{n!}\lambda^{n}\langle x(t)^{n}\rangle_{C}\right]\end{aligned}$$
</div>

For OU, we know the cumulants hence
<div>
$$p(x,t)=\sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi D(1-e^{-2a(t-t_{0})})}}\exp\left(\frac{-a(x-ye^{-a(t-t_{0})})^{2}}{D(1-e^{-2a(t-t_{0})})}\right)$$
</div>

### Statistical mechanics of the neocortex

Having spent some time on how path integrals can be used as
calculation devices for studying stochastic DEs, we now turn to some
specific examples of their use in neuroscience.

Neural field models
-------------------

A neural field model represents a continuum approximation to neural
activity (particularly in models of cortex). They are often expressed as
integro-differential equations:
<div>
$$dU=\left[-U+\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}w(x-y)F(U(y,t))dy\right]dt$$
</div>
where
$U=U(x,t)$ may be either the mean firing rate or a measure of synaptic
input at position $x$ and time $t$. The function $w(x,y)=w(|x-y|)$ is a
weighting function often taken to represent the synaptic weight as a
function of distance from $x$. $F(U)$ is a measure of the firing rate as
a function of inputs. For tractability, $F$ may often be taken to be a
heaviside function, or a sigmoid curve. It is called a field because
each continuous point $x$ is assigned a value $U$, instead of modelling
the activity of individual neurons. A number of spatio-temporal pattern
forming systems may be studied in the context of these models. The
formation of ocular-dominance columns, geometric hallucinations,
persistent ‘bump models’ of activity associated with working memory, and
perceptual switching in optical illusions are all examples of pattern
formation that can be modelled by such a theory. Refer to Bressloff 2012
for a comprehensive review.

The addition of additive noise to the above model:
<div>
$$dU=\left[-U+\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}w(x-y)F(U(y,t))dy\right]dt+g(U)dW(x,t)\label{eq:neuralfield}$$
</div>
for $dW(x,t)$ a white noise process has been studied by Bressloff
 from both a path integral approach, and by studying a
perturbation expansion of the resulting master equation more directly.
We describe briefly how the path integral approach is formulated, and
the results that can be computed as a result. More details are found in
Bressloff 2009.

As above, this is discretized in both time and space to give:
<div>
$$U_{i+1,m}-U_{i,m}=\left[-U_{i,m}+\Delta d\sum_{n}w_{mn}F(U_{i,n})\right]\Delta t+\frac{\sqrt{\Delta t}}{\sqrt{\Delta d}}g(U_{i,m})dW_{i,m}+\Phi_{m}\delta_{i,0}$$
</div>
for initial condition function $\Phi(x)=U(x,0).$ Where each noise
process is a zero-mean, delta correlated process:
<div>
$$\langle dW_{i,m}\rangle=0,\quad\langle dW_{i,m}dW_{j,n}\rangle=\delta_{i,j}\delta_{m,n}.$$
</div>
Let $U$ and $W$ represent vectors with components $U_{i,m}$ and
$W_{i,m}$ such that we can write down the probability density function
conditioned on a particular realization of $W$:
<div>
$$P(U|W)=\prod_{n}\prod_{i=1}^{N}\delta\left(U_{i+1,m}-U_{i,m}+\left[U_{i,m}-\Delta d\sum_{n}w_{mn}F(U_{i,n})\right]\Delta t-\frac{\sqrt{\Delta t}}{\sqrt{\Delta d}}g(U_{i,m})dW_{i,m}-\Phi_{m}\delta_{i,0}\right)$$
</div>
where we again use the Fourier representation of the delta function:
<div>
$$P(U|W)=\int\prod_{n}\prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{d\tilde{U}_{j,n}}{2\pi}\exp\tilde{-iU_{i,m}}\left(U_{i+1,m}-U_{i,m}+\left[U_{i,m}-\Delta d\sum_{n}w_{mn}F(U_{i,n})\right]\Delta t-\frac{\sqrt{\Delta t}}{\sqrt{\Delta d}}g(U_{i,m})dW_{i,m}-\Phi_{m}\delta_{i,0}\right).$$
</div>
Knowing the density for the random vector $W$ we can write the
probability of a vector $U$:
<div>
$$P(U)=\int\prod_{n}\prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{d\tilde{U}_{j,n}}{2\pi}\exp\tilde{-iU_{i,m}}\left(U_{i+1,m}-U_{i,m}+\left[U_{i,m}-\Delta d\sum_{n}w_{mn}F(U_{i,n})\right]\Delta t+\frac{\Delta t}{2\Delta d}g^{2}(U_{i,m})\tilde{U}_{i,m}-\Phi_{m}\delta_{i,0}\right).$$
</div>
Taking the continuum limit gives the density:
<div>
$$P[U]=\int\mathcal{D}\tilde{U}e^{-S[U,\tilde{U}]},$$
</div>
for action
<div>
$$S[U,\tilde{U}]=\int dx\int_{0}^{T}dt\tilde{U}\left[U_{t}(x,t)+U(x,t)-\int w(x-y)F(U(y,t))dy-\Phi(x)\delta(t)-\frac{1}{2}\tilde{U}^{2}g^{2}(U(x,t))\right].$$
</div>
Given the action, the moment generating functional and propagator can be
defined as previously. In linear cases the moments can be computed
exactly.

### The weak-noise expansion

If the noise term is scaled by a small parameter, $g(U)\to\sigma g(U)$
for $\sigma\ll1.$ (For instance, in the case of a Langevin approximation
to the master equation, it is the case that $\sigma\approx1/N$ for $N$
the number of neurons.) Rescaling variables
$\tilde{U}\to\tilde{U}/\sigma^{2}$ and
$\tilde{J}\to\tilde{J}/\sigma^{2}$ then the generating functional
becomes:
<div>
$$Z=\int\mathcal{D}U\mathcal{D}\tilde{U}e^{-\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}S[U,\tilde{U}]}e^{\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\int dx\int_{0}^{T}dt[\tilde{U}J+\tilde{J}U]},$$
</div>
which can be thought of in terms of a loop expansion described above. Performing the expansion in orders of
$\sigma$ allows for a ‘semi-classical’ expansion to be performed. The
corrections to the deterministic equations take the form
<div>
$$\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=-v(x,t)+\int w(x-y)F(v(y,t))dy+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\int w(x-y)C(x,y,t)F''(v(y,t))dy+O(\sigma^{4})$$
</div>
for $C(x,y,t)$ the second-order cumulant (covariance) function. The
expression for $C(x,y,t)$ is derived and studied in more detail in Buice
*et al* 2010.

Mean-field Wilson-Cowan equations and corrections
-------------------------------------------------

Another approach using path integrals has been extensively studied by
Buice and Cowan (Buice2007, see also Bresslof
2009). Here, we envision a network of neurons which exist
in one of either two or three states, depending on the time scales of
interest relative to the time scales of the neurons being studied. Each
neuron in the network is modeled as a Markov process which transitions
between active and quiescent states (and refractory, if it’s relevant).

For the two state model, assume that each neuron in the network creates
spikes and that these spikes have an impact on the network dynamics for
an exponentially distributed time given by a decay rate $\alpha.$ Let
$n_{i}$ denote the number of ‘active’ spikes at a given time for neuron
$i$ and let $\mathbf{n}$ denote the state of all neurons at a given
time. We assume that the effect of neuron $j$ on neuron $i$ is given by
the function
<div>
$$f(\sum_{ij}w_{ij}n_{j}+I)$$
</div>
for some firing rate function
$f$ and some external input $I$. Then the master equation for the state
of the system is:
<div>
$$\frac{dP(\mathbf{n},t)}{dt}=\sum_{i}\alpha(n_{i}+1)P(\mathbf{n}_{i+},t)-\alpha n_{i}P(\mathbf{n},t)+f\left(\sum_{ij}w_{ij}n_{j}+I\right)[P(\mathbf{n}_{i-},t)-P(\mathbf{n},t)]$$
</div>
where we denote by $$\mathbf{n}_{i\pm}$$ the state of the network
$$\mathbf{n}$$ with one more or less active spike in neuron $i$. The
assumption is made that each neuron is identical and that the weight
function $$w_{ij}=w_{|i-j|}$$, that is, it only depends on the distance
between the two neurons. Of interest is the mean activity of neuron $i$:
<div>
$$a_{i}(t)=\langle n_{i}(t)\rangle.$$
</div>
Using an operator representation it is possible to derive a stochastic
field theory in the continuum limit ($N\to\infty$ and
$n_{i}(t)\to n(x,t)$) to give moments of $n_{i}(t)$ in terms of the the
interaction between two fields $\varphi(x,t)$ and
$\tilde{\varphi}(x,t)$. The details of the derivation are contained in
the Appendices of Buice and Cowan 2007. These fields can be
related to quantities of interest through
<div>
$$a(x,t)=\langle n(x,t)\rangle=\langle\varphi(x,t)\rangle$$
</div>
and
<div>
$$\langle n(x_{1},t_{1})n(x_{2},t_{2})\rangle=\langle\varphi(x_{1},t_{1})\varphi(x_{2},t_{2})\rangle+\langle\varphi(x_{1},t_{1})\tilde{\varphi}(x_{2},t_{2})\rangle a(x_{2},t_{2})$$
</div>
for $t_{1}>t_{2}$. The propagator, as before, is
<div>
$$G(x_{1},t_{1};x_{2},t_{2})=\langle\varphi(x_{1},t_{1})\tilde{\varphi}(x_{2},t_{2})\rangle$$
</div>
and the generating function is given by
<div>
$$Z[J,\tilde{J}]=\int\mathcal{D}\varphi\mathcal{D}\tilde{\varphi}e^{-S[\varphi,\tilde{\varphi}]+J\tilde{\varphi}+\tilde{J}\varphi}.$$
</div>
For the master equation above the action is given by:
<div>
$$S[\varphi,\tilde{\varphi}]=\int dx\left(\int_{0}^{t}dt\tilde{\varphi}\partial_{t}\varphi+\alpha\tilde{\varphi}\varphi-\tilde{\varphi}f\left(w\star[\tilde{\varphi}\varphi+\varphi]+I\right)\right)-\int dx\,\bar{n}(x)\tilde{\varphi}(x,0),$$
</div>
for convolution $\star$ and initial condition vector $\bar{n}(x).$ This
now allows the action to be divided into a free and interacting action
and for perturbation expansions to be performed.

The loop expansion provides a useful expansion and, as described in
Section 2, amounts to ordering Feynman diagrams by the number of loops
contained in them. The zeroth order, mean field theory, corresponds to
Feyman diagrams containing zero loops. Such diagrams are called tree
diagrams. It can be shown that the dynamics of this expansion obey:
$$\partial_{t}a_{0}(x,t)+\alpha a_{0}(x,t)-f(w\star a_{0}(x,t)+I)=0$$
which are also a simple form of the well known Wilson-Cowan equations.
That these equations are recovered as the zeroth order expansion of the
continuum limit of the master equation gives confidence that the
higher-order terms of the expansion will indeed correspond to relevant
dynamics. The ‘one-loop’ correction is given by:
<div>
$$\partial_{t}a_{1}(x,t)+\alpha a_{1}(x,t)-f(w\star a_{1}(x,t)+I)+h\mathcal{N}(a_{1},\Delta)=0$$
</div>
for
<div>
$$\mathcal{N}(a,\Delta)=\int dx_{1}dx_{2}dx'dt'dx''f^{(2)}(x,t)w(x-x_{1})w(x-x_{2})f^{(1)}(x',t')w(x'-x'')\Delta(x_{1}-x',t-t')\Delta(x_{2}-x'',t-t')a(x'',t')$$
</div>
and the ‘tree-level’ propagator

Summary
=======

We have described how path integrals can be used to compute moments and
densities of a stochastic differential equation, and how they can be
used to perform perturbation expansions around ‘mean-field’, or
classical, solutions. 

Path integral methods, once one is accustomed to their use, can provide
a quick and intuitive way of solving particular problems. However, it is
worth highlighting that there are few examples of problems which can be
solved with path integral methods but not with other, perhaps more
standard, methods. Thus, while they are a powerful and general tool,
their utility is often countered by the fact that, for many problems,
simpler solution techniques exist.

Further, it should be highlighted that the path integral as it was
defined here – as a limit of finite-dimensional integration
($\int\prod_{i}^{N}dx_{i}\to\int\mathcal{D}x(t)$) – does not result in a
valid measure. In some cases the Weiner measure may equivalently be
used, but in other cases the path integral as formulated by Feynman
remains a mathematically unjustified entity.

With these caveats in mind, their principle benefit, then, may instead
come from the intuition that they bring to novel mathematical and
physical problems. When unsure how to proceed, having as many different
ways of approaching a problem can only be beneficial. Indeed, in 1965
Feynman said in his Nobel acceptance lecture: “Theories of the known,
which are described by different physical ideas may be equivalent in all
their predictions and are hence scientifically indistinguishable.
However, they are not psychologically identical when trying to move from
that base into the unknown. For different views suggest different kinds
of modifications which might be made and hence are not equivalent in the
hypotheses one generates from them in one’s attempt to understand what
is not yet understood.”

[^1]: This could be found through first discretizing the SDE, as above,
    and evaluating the resulting multi-variate Gaussian integral, before
    taking the limit.

[^2]: though there is some freedom in how the ‘free’ and ‘interacting’
    components are divided, depending on the problem at hand.

[^3]: *e.g.* in QED this coupling is related to change of electron
    ($e$): $\alpha\approx1/137=\text{fine structure constant}$

[^4]: The expression for the mean and variance I was able to verify (pp.
    83-85 @Gitterman2005). The expression for the covariance I was
    unable to locate in another source to verify; that it reduces to the
    correct variance is encouraging, however.
