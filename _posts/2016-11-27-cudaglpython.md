General-purpose GPU computing is becoming increasingly important in many computational disciplines. This is of course particularly true in discplines that don't stray too far from the GPU's original purpose -- graphics processing. Computer vision and image processing algorithms are thus often well suited for implementation on a GPU. 

Some algorithms may involve both the generation of graphics and the analysis of the resulting rendering. In these cases it can be useful to use a specialized rendering pipeline, OpenGL, say, and then to make available the output of the OpenGL render to a CUDA program. This requires CUDA-OpenGL interoperability.
