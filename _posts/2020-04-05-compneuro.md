Recently I had the opportunity to give a talk to the undergraduate student physics group at Western University. It was a fun exercise to reflect my area of research, computational neuroscience. I introduce the basic questions and framing of the field of computational neuroscience. In particular, focusing on the idea that what separates the field from other areas of mathematical and theoretical biology is its emphasis on _computations_ of the brain. So computers and computation must be defined first, before going further. Check out the slides [here](https://benlansdell.github.io/compneurointro)!
